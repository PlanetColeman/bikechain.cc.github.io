When working with agile experts, they often describe themselves as coaches?

Some argue that to call yourself a coach, you should in fact be a coach, which involves years of experience and a certification.

What do you think about people calling themselves a coach without the skills or experience?

In my opinion, you have informal and formal types of coaching. Informal coaching is can be a powerful management tool and you wouldn’t expect a manager to avoid using the technique without formal training; although it could be useful.

I think agile team coaching is also quite informal coaching and using the title of coach can be a useful reminder that the role is not there to “tell people what to do” but to facilitate the learning within the team.

I don’t see too much harm in this type of scenario, however, I do think you need to know your own limitiations and to call yourself a coach does not mean that you should be having more formal coaching relationships; life coaching, executive coaching etc. 

The role of a coach in a formal setting is a sensitive one and I think the coach and coachee would benefit from the coach having more experience and skills. 

In conclusion, calling yourself a coach is one thing but be self-aware and know your limitations.
